    In electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic
     device used to operate the device from a distance, usually wirelessly.
      For example, in consumer electronics, a remote control can be used
       to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other
        home appliance, from a short distance. A remote control is primarily 
        a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices
         that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls.
          In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device 
          that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage
           door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital
            Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high 
            ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.
